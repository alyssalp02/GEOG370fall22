<!-- Explain the ratio -->
<h2>Ratio</h2>
The ratio I used to create these choropleths was the number of kindergartners enrolled in each county 
divided by the total population of people over the age of 3 in that county. This ratio shows very different results
from the original count choropleth. In some counties, there were very few kindergartners enrolled, but that number was actually a 
higher proportion of the county than in some others.



<!-- Pros + Cons of Classification Schemes -->
<h2>Classification Schemes</h2>
The three classification schemes I used are natural breaks, equal count, and equal interval. 
Natural breaks creates boundaries where there are big differences in data values. They are more helpful more data-specific classifications.
Equal count (quantile) means that each class contains an equal number of features. It is good for linear data but can be misleading.
Equal interval creates equal-sized sections. This is often good for familiar data ranges and values in relation to other values. 

<!-- Note -->
<h2>*Note*</h2>
I had to use new data for this part because I used mean income for part 1, so I could not make a ratio.

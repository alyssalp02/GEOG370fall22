This map shows the states in the US which are experiencing at least a D2 level (severe) drought somewhere within the state.
The map shows the crop which is grown in the largest amount of acres in each state. 
To create this map, I used intersect to see only the states that were at least a D2 drought and intersected that with the agricultural information. Only the states experiencing drought remain on the map.
I then used dissolve to create regions based on the most commonly grown crop instead of looking at individual states.

<br>
<br>
I wanted to see if there was a correlation between states that were in some kind of drought and the types of crops grown there.
By looking at the map, it seems that a majority of areas experiencing drought grow wheat.
